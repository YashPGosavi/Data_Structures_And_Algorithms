/*

* Recursive Bubble Sort in Java : It is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

    1. Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
    2. The recursive version of Bubble Sort reduces the problem size by one in each recursive call.
    3. Time Complexity: O(nÂ²) in the worst and average cases.
    4. Space Complexity: O(n) due to the recursion stack.
