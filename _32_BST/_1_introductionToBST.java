What is a BST?

Binary Search Tree
    a. Left Subtree Nodes < Root
    b. Right Subtree Nodes > Root
    c. Left & Right Subtrees are also BST with no duplicates

Special Property :- Inorder traversal always gives sorted sequence.

To Remember: BST makes search efficient

/*
Strategy
Most problems will be solved using recursion i.e. by dividing into subproblems & making recursive calls on subtrees.
