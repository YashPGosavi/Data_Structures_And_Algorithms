Stack :-
        A list with the restriction that insertion and deletion can be performed only from one end, called the top.    
        Elements are stored in the LIFO (Last In First Out) principle. That is, the last element stored in a stack will be removed first.
        It works just like a pile of plates where the last plate kept on the pile will be removed first. 

        Two types are stack is present 
            1. Implicit stack generates by computer program
            2. Explicit stack devloped by devloper

## Applications
    - Function Calls/Recursion
    - undo in an editor
    - Balanced Parentheses

Operations on Stack :-
    1. push() – Insert an element at one end of the stack called top. [O(1)]              
    2. pop() – Remove and return the element at the top of the stack, if it is not empty. [0(1)]           
    3. peek() – Return the element at the top of the stack without removing it, if the stack is not empty. [O(1)]            
    4. size() – Return the number of elements in the stack.           
    5. isEmpty() – Return true if the stack is empty, otherwise return false.          
    6. isFull() – Return true if the stack is full, otherwise return false. 

 

* There are three ways to implement a stack
    * Using array
    * Using arraylist
    * Using linked list


1 ] Stack using array / ArrayList
                          In representation of stack as an array the size of stack is fixed.
                          Top of stack is Last element of array.
                          So here the condition happed like wastage of memory and or limited space

2 ] Stack using ArrayList
                          In representation of stack as an ArrayList the size of stack is variable.
                          Top of stack is Last element of ArrayList.


3 ] Stack using link list :-
                          Stack can be represented efficiently using link list.
                          Top of stack is head of LinkList.
