/*

A Heap is a special Tree-based data structure in which the tree is a complete binary tree.

* Binary Tree
        at most 2 children

* Complete Binary Tree
        CBT is a BT in which all the levels are completely filled except possibly the last one, which is filled from the left to right.

* Heap Order Property
        1. Children >= Parent (maxHeap)
        2. Children <= Parent (maxHeap)

* Operations of Heap Data Structure:
        1. Heapify: a process of creating a heap from an array.
        2. Insertion: process to insert an element in existing heap time complexity O(log N).
        3. Deletion: deleting the top element of the heap or the highest priority element, and then organizing the heap and returning the element with time complexity O(log N).
        4. Peek: to check or find the first (or can say the top) element of the heap.

* Types of Heap Data Structure : Generally, Heaps can be of two types:

        1. Max-Heap: In a Max-Heap the key present at the root node must be greatest among the keys present at all of it’s children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.

        2. Min-Heap: In a Min-Heap the key present at the root node must be minimum among the keys present at all of it’s children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.
