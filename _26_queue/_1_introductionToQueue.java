/* 

Queue :-
      Queue follows the First In First Out (FIFO) rule - the item that goes in first is the item that comes out first. 
      It is just like line for ticket counter in theatre so the first man who got ticket get out the line and the new join the line at end for ticket.

Implemantation of Queue :-
        1. Using Array
        2. Using LinkedList
        3. Using Stack

Operation in Queue :-

     Time Complexity : O(n)

    1. enqueue : add an element to the tail of a queue
    2. dequeue : remove an element from the head of a queue
    3. first : examine the element at the head of the queue (“peek”)
Other useful operations (e.g. is the queue empty)
It is not legal to access the elements in the middle of the queue!

Application of Queue :-

    1. For any kind of problem involving FIFO data.
    2. Printer queue.
    3. Keyboard input buffer.
    4. GUI event queue (click on buttons, menu items).
    5. To encode messages.
